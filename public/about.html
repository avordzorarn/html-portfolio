<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I graduated from the University of Ghana in 1985. After a couple of years doing a number of dead end jobs, I decided to leave my country of origin.
I decided to come the the United States to further my education for a better job prospect. I completed my MBA in Finance at the Pace University in June 1998.
I have been working in the financial services industry since then. I currently work with the SEC in Washington DC as a Financial Analyst.</p>

<p>I have decided to take the full stack web development course so I can do some free lancing work when I retire in 4 years time. Contact me so we can talk.</p>
